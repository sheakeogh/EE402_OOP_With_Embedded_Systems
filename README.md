# EE402 Object Oriented Programming with Embedded Systems

A repository of code for the EE402 course. This repository contains code from Tutorials, Assignments, and Past Papers.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment we were tasked to design and build a client/server application, where multiple clients devices(simulated embedded robots) send their location and status to a server where this information is displayed graphically on a server map display.

To run this, first run the serverApp.java file. Then you must run the clientApp by executing the following line
<code>java clientApp localhost RobotName</code>
